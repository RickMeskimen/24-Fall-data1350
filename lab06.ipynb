    "We can make a visual argument as to whether we believe the observed statistic is consistent with Emily’s model. Here, since larger values of the test statistic suggest the alternative model (where the chance of guessing the correct hand is something other than 50%), we can formalize our analysis by finding what proportion of simulated statistics were as large or larger than our observed test statistic (the area at or to the right of the observed test statistic). If this area is small enough, we’ll declare that the observed data are inconsistent with our simulated model. Here is the [link](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/11/1/Assessing_a_Model.html) to the section in the textbook."

If the proportion of simulated statistics greater than or equal to the observed statistic is sufficiently small (less than or equal to 0.05), then this is evidence against Emily's model.
